The version of the DBLP graph in this repository was obtained by:
	1) Downloading the original DBLP graph from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-DBLP.html.
	2) Converting the original DBLP graph to an adjacency list format using the Ligra SNAPtoAdj graph converter available at https://github.com/jshun/ligra/blob/master/utils/SNAPtoAdj.C
	3) Converting the adjacency list format to the adjacency list binary format using the Ligra adjToBinary graph converter available at https://github.com/jshun/ligra/blob/master/utils/adjToBinary.C

Thanks to the SNAP or Standard Network Analysis Project (https://snap.stanford.edu) for making these graphs publicly available.
Thanks to Julian Shun (https://people.csail.mit.edu/jshun/) for making Ligra (https://github.com/jshun/ligra) publicly available.
